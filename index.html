  <!--turtle fades in on hover and grows, then click links to next page-->



  <!--starts with the clouds only, a hover makes one of the turtles appear swimming in them, click on the turtle and it changes to a new page, this page is a similar landscape with the clouds at the bottom but //i need 10 interactions across multiple pages so maybe ill do like 5, then there needs to be 3 different types of interactions so a click a hover and an on mouse over?? sure//whats the narrative here,,, its a dream landscape so maybe it just gets weirder ,, like on the first page theres nothing ther ebut after like 5 seconds the turtle fades in and then when you hover over it it gets bigger then you click on it to go to the next page,,, keep the aesthetic the whole time, with pinks and blues - try to transfer the color filters to all files// the next page could be space, i would like to try to carry the clouds over between pages but idk if that will work,, so theres planets and the turtle is still around somewhere but in the bg facing the other direction, then a jellyfish floats accross the page when you mouse over and something else shows up behind it that you can click on that takes you to the next page,, this one is underwater and theres trees and plants and animals that dont belong there like deer and birds or something and this is when it ,, the next page is a desert and theres like sharks swimming in the sand and an octopus on a cactus or something,, the next page looks normal like a field but theres nothing around and after a few seconds everywhere your mouse hovers over starts glitching because the dream is starting to end and eventually you can click on something and it takes you back into the clouds with the all of the things you clicked on plus like flowers and watever else and after like 5 or 10 seconds everything starts fading away like youre waking up from the dream ,,, i think i could do that by putting a white box over the whole thing anf change the opactiry on a timer so that when its on that page before it fades and while its fading you can hover over things and they'll disappear
